Note: This blog was originally condensed into Week 2 and 3 but I decided that looked ugly so separating its own week out here. 

Some random updates this week. I signed up for a Brazilian jiu-jitsu gym, and now I hope I don’t break a finger because I still haven’t figured out how the health insurance works here. I think it is definitely a bit more struggle since they don’t really speak English in the gym, so I am learning the techniques just by watching. Also, I got really tired of Korean food during these past two weeks, so I spent a lot of time finding different restaurants that we have in California that I wanted to eat. This usually ended up being restaurants like McDonalds, but I also went one time to HaiDiLao in Hongdae and it was really good.
