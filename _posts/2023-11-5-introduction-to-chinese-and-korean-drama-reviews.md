    A quick introduction on what I am planning my drama reviews to look like.
---

Hello! This will be a very quick introduction on how I plan to write my reviews on the Korean/Chinese dramas that I watch going forward. 

The reviews themselves will be extremely subjective. I tend to rate dramas based on the level of enjoyment that I got from it, and not only on objective measures such as acting or music. This is because although I could analyze the plot completely and criticize the acting indefinitely for every drama, what makes a drama good to watch in the end is how much entertainment and comfort I got from it. A good plot and good acting can be part of that, it also doesn’t have to be. One good example of this for me is the Chinese drama Love Between Fairy and Devil. I found that it had a pretty mundane and inconsistent plot, but the chemistry between the two leads was enough for me to really enjoy the drama, allowing me to almost ignore the flawed plot completely. 

However, apart from the subjective rating and feelings about the drama, I will attempt to do thorough reviews and evaluate everything. Right now, the things that come to mind are plot/story, romance (if it’s a romance drama), cast, acting, characters, pacing, music. I’m sure when I come around to writing my first drama review that more categories will occur to me. My goal here is apart from the level of enjoyment that I got from the drama, I hope to be able to try to unbiasedly review the drama as well. I want to be able to write well enough about a drama that someone can read it and see if it would be a drama that they would be interested in watching. I am not too sure how I am going to incorporate these subjective and objective reviews together, but I will probably have it figured out by my first review. Anyways, I am currently watching a Chinese drama called _Meet Yourself_, so hopefully a review on that drama is coming soon!

I am always trying to fix some time to watch dramas every week, but with a busy first semester and an anticipated busy next semester as well, these drama reviews might come out a bit more slowly than I'd like. However, If you want to get current information about what dramas I’m currently watching or have watched in the past, please check out my MyDramaList linked [here](https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/Fufucandy "Link to my MDL"){:target="_blank"}. I always keep this up to date and it is the best way to tag along with me watching dramas. Of course, there you can see my scores for previous dramas I have watched. Don’t be afraid to ask why I gave a rating that I did, and feel free to recommend any shows that I have not already watched!
